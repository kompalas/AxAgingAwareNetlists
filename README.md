# AxAgingAwareNetlists: Approximate Netlists Generated with Aging-Aware Optimization

This repository contains **approximate hardware netlists** generated using a **genetic algorithm (GA)-based aging-aware optimization** approach.  
The netlists are organized to provide insight into how **circuit approximation** can mitigate **circuit aging effects** while optimizing energy and performance.

## ðŸ”§ Repository Structure

- `baseline/` â€“ Original baseline circuit netlists  
- `ax_pre_synthesis/` â€“ Approximate netlists directly generated by the GA optimization (before synthesis)  
- `ax_post_synthesis/` â€“ Fully synthesized approximate netlists after optimization  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Highlights

- Aging-aware optimization to improve circuit lifetime  
- Approximate circuits generated via genetic algorithms  
- Includes both **raw** and **synthesized** netlists for reproducibility  
- Complements the methodology from the cited paper below
